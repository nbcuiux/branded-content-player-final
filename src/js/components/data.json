Elliot suffers from social anxiety disorder, clinical depression, delusions and paranoia. His internal life is revealed via voice-overs that provide insight into his mental state, his opinions of the people he encounters and the activity around him. These dialogues with the audience are designed to help us interpret Elliot's world, but given his mental illness, he is an unreliable narrator, leaving us unsure whether what he tells us we're seeing is actually what is happening. Typical of this is when Elliot hears everyone around him refer to E Corp as Evil Corp, reflecting his own opinion of the conglomerate.",

He is of Egyptian descent; his parents are Coptic Christians who emigrated from Egypt before he was born. Malek studied theater performance and earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree at the University of Evansville. He is known for his role as the gay teenage next-door-neighbor, 'Kenny' on the FOX comedy series The War at Home; for his role as Merriell 'Snafu' Shelton in the HBO miniseries The Pacific; his role in 2013's 'Short Term 12' as Nate; and for his role as the pharaoh Ahkmenrah in the feature films Night at the Museum, Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian, and Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb. He also played Benjamin in the final installment of The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn. He also played Joshua (Josh) Washington in the hit 2015 video game, Until Dawn.",

It eventually becomes clear that Mr. Robot is a construct within Elliot Alderson's mind. (“eps1.8_m1rr0r1ng.qt”) His persona is an idealized representation of Elliot's deceased father, Edward; where Edward was unwilling or unable to take action, Mr. Robot was created to inspire war against E Corp and incite historical change. In some situations, Mr. Robot will take control and act through Elliot, thus explaining his direct interactions with other people. ",

Elliot suffers from social anxiety disorder, clinical depression, delusions and paranoia. His internal life is revealed via voice-overs that provide insight into his mental state, his opinions of the people he encounters and the activity around him. These dialogues with the audience are designed to help us interpret Elliot's world, but given his mental illness, he is an unreliable narrator, leaving us unsure whether what he tells us we're seeing is actually what is happening. Typical of this is when Elliot hears everyone around him refer to E Corp as Evil Corp, reflecting his own opinion of the conglomerate.",

He is of Egyptian descent; his parents are Coptic Christians who emigrated from Egypt before he was born. Malek studied theater performance and earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree at the University of Evansville. He is known for his role as the gay teenage next-door-neighbor, 'Kenny' on the FOX comedy series The War at Home; for his role as Merriell 'Snafu' Shelton in the HBO miniseries The Pacific; his role in 2013's 'Short Term 12' as Nate; and for his role as the pharaoh Ahkmenrah in the feature films Night at the Museum, Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian, and Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb. He also played Benjamin in the final installment of The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn. He also played Joshua (Josh) Washington in the hit 2015 video game, Until Dawn.",
